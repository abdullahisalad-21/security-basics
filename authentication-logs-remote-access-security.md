**✅ SECURITY BASICS — Documentation
🗂️ Overview**
I reviewed authentication logs, remote access security, and system monitoring as part of Module 6. I analyzed both Windows and Linux logs to understand security‑relevant events.
**🎯 Objectives**
• 	Understand secure remote access.
• 	Identify authentication events in logs.
• 	Monitor systems for suspicious activity.
**🛠️ Tools & Commands Used**
• 	Event Viewer (Security logs)
• 	/var/log/auth.log
• 	SSH
• 	RDP
• 	PuTTY
**🧩 Steps Completed**
• 	Reviewed Windows security logs for logon events.
• 	Checked Linux authentication logs for SSH activity.
• 	Verified remote access security settings.
• 	Ensured encrypted protocols (SSH, RDP) were used.
**🐞 Problems & Fixes**
• 	SSH warnings: Cleared outdated host keys.
• 	RDP prompts: Ensured secure password handling.
• 	Log noise: Filtered logs to isolate authentication events.
**📘 What I Learned**
• 	Remote access must always be secured and monitored.
• 	Authentication logs are critical for detecting unauthorized access.
• 	Both OSes provide detailed logs for security auditing.
**🚀 Next Steps**
• 	Enable SSH key authentication.
• 	Configure Windows audit policies.
• 	Practice correlating security events across systems.

# Security Fundamentals for IT Support

This repository contains my security learning and hands-on practice. It covers essential concepts used in real IT environments, including password policies, ACLs, least privilege, and system hardening.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Password policy configuration
- Access Control Lists (ACL, DACL, SACL, ACE)
- Least privilege implementation
- System hardening techniques
- Security awareness and customer-facing security skills

## Repository Structure
- password-policies.md  
- acl-theory.md  
- least-privilege.md  
- system-hardening.md  
- certificates.md  

## Purpose
This repo shows my understanding of security principles required for IT Support, SysAdmin, and cybersecurity pathways.

### Access Control & Permission Security
Today I strengthened my understanding of system security by practicing:

- Windows ACLs (DACLs, ACEs, inheritance)
- Linux permission models (rwx for user, group, other)
- Ownership changes using `chown`
- Permission modification using `chmod`
- Applying least-privilege principles
- Securing sensitive files and folders

These are foundational security skills for both system and network administration.
